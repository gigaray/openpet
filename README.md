## Information flow
- Challenges - leaky info flow, insufficient info flow
- Clarity on Contextual integrity
- Privacy dilemma vs transparency dilemma

## Privacy-transparency  tradeoff
- Traditional

As shown above for the same amount of 'B' there is more 'A' (when compared to the 'Traditional'). Thus prviacy-transparency tradeoff - need not be a Zero sum game. Creating information flows within society that create social good.

## 3 technical problems
when addressed will take privacy-transaparency tradeoff in traditional realm to the realm of the pareto frontier

|Problem|definition|example|how to overcome?|
| --- | --- |--- | --- |
|Copy Problem|lose control over 'own' data once that data is shared, Difficultt to enforce |Digital Piracy| HIPPA or GDPR or CCPA DRM|
|Bundling problem | revealing unnecessary  / dditional information along with intended information | DL being verified for age, leaks address, AI Governance, Using CC for trial| --- |
|Recurisve enorcement problem | when enforcing privacy regulations who enfores the enforcer, data governance |--- | systems of decentralized governance |

## Structured Transparency
- enable transparency without the risk of misuse
- structured approach to analyze privacy issues
